# Hello, @mkhangg is me! ðŸ¥Ÿ

<img align="right" width=340px src="https://mkhangg.com/assets/img/baxter_cartoon_transparent_bg.png"/>

I am currently a fourth-year Computer Science undergraduate at the <a href="https://cse.uta.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Texas at Arlington</a> and a research assistant at the Learning and Adaptive Robotics Lab, where I am advised by <a href="https://www.uta.edu/academics/faculty/profile?username=huber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Manfred Huber</a>. (â—•â–¿â—•)

`
I do research in robotics, mainly focusing on applying cognitive architectures to robotic grasping to enable robots with a closely similar human grasping capability (e.g., the robot comes into the kitchen, finds a banana, grasps without crushing it, and brings it back to you).
